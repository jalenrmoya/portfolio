        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Here you can learn all about me!</p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My name is Jalen Moya, and I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor's program of Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington, and I am set to graduate in May of 2025.
          I am also minoring in Game Design along with my major. I am originally from Jasper, Indiana, where I graduted from Jasper High School with an Academic Honors diploma.</p>
        <p>Some of my earliest memories in life come from watching, and attempting to play, video games. My father was, and still is, a big gamer so everything I know I have learned from him.
          I grew up watching him beat the original Mario, play classic JRPGs such as Final Fantasy, and fall in love with newer titles such as Fortnite. When I was old enough to start playing games on my own,
          I became obsessed with sports games (NCAA Football, Madden, etc.), first-person shooters (Call of Duty), fighting games (Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3), and sandbox games (Minecraft). From here, my love of games
          only grew. From that young age, I decided that I wanted to anything related to video games (or technology in general) for my professional career.</p>
        <p>As I grew up and went through different phases, my love for games and tech only grew. I found myself in Computer Science courses in high school, and constantly playing new games trying to keep up with the industry.
          However, I did not let video games control my life, as I was very busy with Varsity Football, and having an after school job at the local grocery store, Houchen's Hometown IGA. From these two cornerstones of my high school experience,
          I learned the art of balance. I made sure I had time to do any sort of fun activities with friends/family/myself, but also made sure to do well in school and be impressive at work.</p>
